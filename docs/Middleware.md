## Middleware

### Logger
`middleware/logger.middleware.ts` logs requests with method, path, status, and duration.

### Error Handler
`middleware/error.middleware.ts` catches thrown errors and formats consistent JSON responses.

### CORS/Helmet (if enabled)
Add standard security middleware at the server layer as needed.
